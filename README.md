# poke_card
Pokemon card generator from pokeball

# instructions
This was to just play around and do something fun for my son.

To use:
Just type the name of a pokemon (spelling matters, there is no autofill yet) and click
the glowing center of the pokeball. 

# future iterations
As time allows I plan to build an autofill/suggest feature as you type a Pokemon's
name based on data available from the fetch request.

Also thought about building out an account portal so people could use
use local storage (or mongoDB) to add or remove cards from a deck.
